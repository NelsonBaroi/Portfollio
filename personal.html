  <!-- Early Life and Education -->
  <section id="education" class="section">
    <h2>My Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Bangladesh, a country rich in culture and resilience. Growing up, I was fortunate to have a supportive family that instilled in me the values of integrity, hard work, and empathy. These values have guided me throughout my life and career.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic journey began in my hometown, where I completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) with distinctions in Business Studies. These early achievements fueled my curiosity about how businesses operate and thrive. However, I knew that to truly grow and make a difference, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and explore new horizons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuit of this goal, I moved to Russia to study at <a href="https://eng.kalmgu.ru/" target="_blank">Kalmyk State University</a>, where I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in <strong>Business Informatics</strong>. Studying abroad as the only foreign student in my class was both challenging and rewarding. It taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of cultural sensitivity. I quickly learned to navigate unfamiliar environments, build relationships, and embrace diverse perspectives—skills that have proven invaluable in my professional life.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at university, I worked tirelessly to excel academically while also engaging in extracurricular activities. My thesis, <em>"The Use of Computer Technology for Intensification of Business Processes in the Field of Forecasting,"</em> allowed me to explore how technology can drive efficiency in business operations. This project deepened my understanding of data analysis, process optimization, and the transformative power of technology—a lesson that has stayed with me throughout my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluent in Bengali, English, and Russian, I’ve been able to communicate effectively across diverse teams and environments. Language has always been a bridge for me, connecting people and ideas in ways that foster collaboration and mutual understanding.

  <!-- Professional Journey -->
  <section id="professional-journey" class="section">
    <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
    <p>
      After completing my studies, I returned to Bangladesh with a desire to apply what I had learned to real-world challenges. In January 2019, I joined <strong>AMT Engineering JSC</strong> as a <strong>Senior Administrator</strong>, supporting the day-to-day operations of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant project. This role exposed me to the intricacies of large-scale construction projects and taught me the importance of attention to detail, teamwork, and effective communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Senior Administrator, I managed a wide range of responsibilities, from overseeing procurement and logistics to preparing financial reports, managing payroll, and ensuring compliance with safety standards. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. I took pride in supporting my colleagues, resolving conflicts, and fostering a positive work environment. Every task, no matter how small, was an opportunity to contribute to the success of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February 2024, I was entrusted with the responsibility of leading the Bangladesh branch as its <strong>Director</strong>. This role has been both humbling and inspiring, as it allows me to guide a team of talented individuals toward achieving our shared goals. As Director, I oversee budgets, contracts, employee welfare, and safety standards, ensuring that all operations align with organizational objectives. While I’m proud of what we’ve achieved as a team, I remain committed to continuous improvement and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to <a href="https://www.freyssinet.com/" target="_blank">FREYSSINET</a>, another key player in the Rooppur project, as both a <strong>Procurement Manager</strong> and <strong>Administrative Staff</strong>. These roles have honed my ability to navigate complex challenges while maintaining a positive and productive work environment. Whether it’s sourcing materials, managing administrative tasks, or fostering collaboration among team members, I approach every responsibility with dedication and humility.

  <!-- Contributions Beyond Work -->
  <section id="contributions-beyond-work" class="section">
    <h2>Contributions Beyond Work</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond my professional life, I’m deeply committed to giving back to my community. Volunteering and participating in student organizations during my university years taught me the value of service and empathy. Today, I continue to support initiatives that uplift others and contribute to Bangladesh’s development. Whether it’s mentoring young professionals, advocating for workplace safety, or participating in community projects, I believe that even small actions can create lasting impacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m particularly passionate about education and skill development, as I’ve seen firsthand how access to knowledge and opportunities can transform lives. By supporting initiatives that empower individuals to reach their full potential, I hope to contribute to a brighter future for my community and country.
